# Introduction

Art Gallery is a significant platform, seamlessly bringing together artists and a large community of art lovers. With the help of this platform, artists can promote their works while giving customers a simple way to find and buy one-of-a-kind items.

# Anticipated Technologies

The Art Gallery project will employ React.js for frontend development, while the backend will rely on Node.js and Express. MySQL will handle database operations, particularly concerning user profiles and art listings. Security will be bolstered by implementing a two-step registration verification process. The project will emphasize responsive design and utilize CSS frameworks to ensure smooth user experiences across different devices. Additionally, a RESTful API will streamline communication between frontend and backend components, enhancing overall efficiency.

# Method/Approach

### Project Setup:

Create a new project directory/repository dedicated to the Art Gallery project. Set up version control (e.g., Git) to monitor changes.

### Backend Configuration:

Using Node.js and Express, create the backend environment. Install all necessary dependencies, such as the Express and MySQL libraries. Create the server.js file for the main server and configure the routing.

### Database Setup:

Create the tables and basic data for the MySQL database. Create a connection between MySQL and the backend using an ORM (like Sequelize) or direct queries.

### User Authentication:

Enforce user authentication, incorporating two-step verification during registration. Develop routes and controllers for user registration and login.

### User Profiles:

Create the database structure and design the user profiles (such as name, email, and phone number). Implement user profile management API endpoints (such as profile retrieval and profile updating).

### Art Listings:

Define the title, description, and price fields in the database schema for art listings. Establish API endpoints for actions like adding, editing, and removing art listings.

### Frontend Initialization:

Initialize a React.js project within the client directory. Set up requisite dependencies (e.g., React Router for routing).

### User Interface Development:

Create elements for various pages (such as Home, Art Listings, and User Profile). Forms for user login, profile editing, and registration should be integrated.

### Integration with Backend:

Using API calls (such as Axios), link the frontend and backend together. Make sure answers and mistakes are handled correctly.

### Art Listing Display:

Craft components and pages for showcasing individual art listings and galleries.

### Documentation:

Generate comprehensive documentation encompassing the codebase, API endpoints, and any imperative user guides or tutorials intended for artists and buyers.

# Estimated Timeline

The Art Gallery project has been broken down into phases with estimated completion dates. The first week-long phase lasts for project setup and backend configuration. This involves setting up directories, starting version control, and setting up the Node.js and Express backend. The following two-week phase, which includes MySQL database construction and user authentication integration, deals with database setup and user authentication. The creation of user-profiles and art listings will take two more weeks, with an emphasis on the database schema and API endpoint development. An estimated two weeks will be needed for the setup of the front end and the construction of the user interface using React.js. The installation of authentication will take two weeks, as well as integration with the backend. The construction of the art listing display and UI fine-tuning, with a focus on component creation and UI improvement, will take a further two weeks. An anticipated one week will pass during the last step, which includes optimization, documentation, and a final evaluation. These schedules are rough estimates that might change depending on how the project develops and if new difficulties arise.

# Anticipated Problems

### Implementation of Two-Step Verification:
Problem: Including a safe two-step verification procedure during registration might be difficult, necessitating careful consideration of the best approach to guarantee both security and usability.
Solution: To select a trustworthy two-step verification technique that will ensure its efficacy and a seamless user experience, extensive study and testing will be done.

### Upkeep of Art Listings:
Problem: An increasing quantity of art listings might make management challenging, posing difficulties with appropriate classification, revisions, and potential problems with duplicate or expired listings.
Solution: To successfully address these issues, robust database management standards will be put into place. These practices will include frequent audits, automated processes for adding and removing entries, and clear instructions for artists on how to maintain their listings.
