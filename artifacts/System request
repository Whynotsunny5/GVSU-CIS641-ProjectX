System Request - Art Gallery
Project Sponsor: Tharun Jamal, Haris Roshan Shaik
Business Need:
Art Gallery is a significant platform, seamlessly bringing together 
artists and a large community of art lovers. With the help of this 
platform, artists can promote their works while giving customers a
simple way to find and buy one-of-a-kind items.
Business Requirements:
1.Establish distinct user roles (Artists, Buyers) with individualized 
profiles.
2.Establish a mechanism for user interaction through 
communication.
3.Make a profile and art collection exploring possible.
4.Ensure robust user authentication and authorization protocols.
Business Value:
The Art Gallery initiative establishes a user-friendly platform 
connecting artists and buyers. It encourages artists to showcase 
and monetize their work while providing buyers with an intuitive 
interface to explore diverse artworks. Through direct messaging, 
it fosters collaboration and personalized art experiences. The 
platform's curation enhances the buying process, making art 
more accessible and enjoyable. Additionally, it serves as an 
educational resource, enriching art appreciation.
Special Issues or Constraints:
To heighten platform security, we need to introduce a multi-step 
verification system, sending OTPs to registered contact 
information. The insistence on precise contact details deters the 
creation of anonymous or unverified accounts, fostering a secure 
and trustworthy community.
It's crucial to introduce the site to reputable artists and art fans to
build user recognition. By ensuring widespread accessibility and 
exposure, this outreach effort will draw in a wide range of users.
It is imperative to ensure that the project is designed for 
scalability as the user base may grow in the future.
